\##904. Fruit Into Baskets

Medium

In a row of trees, the `i`-th tree produces fruit with type `tree[i]`.

You **start at any tree of your choice**, then repeatedly perform the following steps:

1. Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets. If you cannot, stop.
2. Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree. If there is no tree to the right, stop.

Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of  starting tree: you must perform step 1, then step 2, then back to step  1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.

You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of  fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one type of fruit each.

What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,2].
If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [0, 1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can collect [2,3,2,2].
If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [1, 2].
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1,1,2].
If we started at the first tree or the eighth tree, we would only collect 4 fruits.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= tree.length <= 40000`
2. `0 <= tree[i] < tree.length`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
int totalFruit(vector<int>& tree) {
	unordered_map<int, int> m;
	int minval = 0, maxsize = 0, index = 0;

	for(auto it : tree){
		if(!m.count(it) and m.size() == 2){//这里条件是遇到hashmap没有存的，且此时hashmap的长度是2;
			int val, pos = INT_MAX;
			for(auto i : m){ // only 2 times that is constant
				if(i.second < pos)//这里需要对index进行比较，找出小的那个
					pos = i.second, val = i.first;
			}
			m.erase(val);  //hashmap删除index较小的那个数，
			minval = pos + 1;//窗口右移动
		}
		m[it] = index; //将it的index添加到hashmap;
		maxsize = max(maxsize, index - minval + 1);
		index++;// index是窗口的右边框，minival是窗口的左边框;
	}
	return maxsize;
}

};
```





这个题属于 典型的 移动窗口 + hashmap的题目;
