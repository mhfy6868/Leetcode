763. Partition Labels
Medium

A string S of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

 

Example 1:

Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

 

Note:

    S will have length in range [1, 500].
    S will consist of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z') only.


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> partitionLabels(string S) {
        vector<int> m_(128,0);
        for (int i=0;i<S.size();i++){
            m_[S[i]] = i;
            
        }
        vector<int> ans;
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        for (int i=0;i<S.size();i++){
            end = max(end, m_[S[i]]);
            if (i==end){
                ans.push_back(end-start+1);
                start = end +1;
            }
            
        }
        
        return ans;
        
    }
};
```



这个题关键在于hashtable，

我们将所有letter 构建 [letter] -> {最后出现序号i}的hashtable

然后max(end, i ) 就能知道这一组letter最后出现的位置;

依照这个去遍历 ，就能得到数组。
