\##424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

Medium

Given a string `s` that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most `k` operations on that string.

In one operation, you can choose **any** character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

**Note:**
 Both the string's length and *k* will not exceed 104.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s = "ABAB", k = 2

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s = "AABABBA", k = 1

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```





```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
        int low = 0;
        unordered_map<char,int> m_;
        int most_frequent_count;
        int maxLength = 0;
        for (int high = 0;high <s.length(); high++){
           int current_char_count = ++m_[s[high]];
    most_frequent_count=max(most_frequent_count,current_char_count);
            while(high -low +1 -most_frequent_count > k){
                m_[s[low]]--;
                low++;   
            }            
             maxLength = max(most_frequent_count,high-low+1);
        }        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```



这个题是经典的sliding window。

sliding window的一个模板：

```c++
int low = 0;

for (int high = 0;high <s.length(); high++){ //开始时high 与 low都为0, 以high增加写for循环;

	while(high -low +1 -most_frequent_count > k){//用来控制滑窗，1.low向上移动，2.pop掉移动所抛弃的element;
                m_[s[low]]--;    
                low++; 
	
}

	maxLength = max(maxLength, low - high +1); 

return maxLength;



```
