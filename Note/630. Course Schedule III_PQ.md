\##630. Course Schedule III

Hard

There are `n` different online courses numbered from `1` to `n`. Each course has some duration(course length) `t` and closed on `dth` day. A course should be taken **continuously** for `t` days and must be finished before or on the `dth` day. You will start at the `1st` day.

Given `n` online courses represented by pairs `(t,d)`, your task is to find the maximal number of courses that can be taken.

**Example:**

```
Input: [[100, 200], [200, 1300], [1000, 1250], [2000, 3200]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
There're totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:
First, take the 1st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101st day.
Second, take the 3rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101st day. 
Third, take the 2nd course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300th day. 
The 4th course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300th day, which exceeds the closed date.
```

 

**Note:**

1. The integer 1 <= d, t, n <= 10,000.
2. You can't take two courses simultaneously.



```c++
class Solution {
    static bool cmp(vector<int>&a,vector<int>&b)
    {
        return a[1]<b[1];
    }
public:
    int scheduleCourse(vector<vector<int>>& courses) {
        sort(courses.begin(),courses.end(),cmp);    
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        int day = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<courses.size();i++){
            if(day+courses[i][0]<=courses[i][1]){
                day += courses[i][0];
                pq.push(courses[i][0]);
            }
            else{
                day += courses[i][0];
                pq.push(courses[i][0]);
                day -=pq.top();
                pq.pop();
            } 
        }
        return pq.size();
    }
};
```



这个题要注意sort cmp的写法，还可以这么写：（用于比较list中元素第二项大小）

```c++
sort(courses.begin(), courses.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
```

逻辑上用了priority_queue, 用于把每门课的长度push进去，自动排序，然后当长度不够的时候，把最长的那个从queue中pop出去，这时候也对day进行更新，以此来进行下去;

这里没有用滑动窗口，也没有取 max(a,b) , 题目类型不一样 。
